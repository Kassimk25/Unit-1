    <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>My name is Kassim Asman. I'm 19 years old and attending STC as a computer programmer. I'm attempting to build my skills
    and apply them to real projects. My goal is to open doors to different opportunities in the future and achieve comfortability.

<h2>Fun facts</h2>

<p>I enjoy playing basketball in my free time. I began playing during sophmore year in high school. 
    The reason I enjoyed it is because of how much room there is to grow and learn new moves. During junior year, I had enhanced
my handling and gotten my first dunk. It was only uphill from there. </p>

<p>I've always been a problem solver. This is the same reason why I enjoy working on projects of any kind. Whether it be cars, 
    basic maintenace or programming. These all interest me very much and I jump at the opportunity attempting to work on them.
    I'm constantly seeking knowledge.

<p>I've never been a picky eater but the issue I've got is with with avocados. Hate may be a strong word but I truly hate 
    these items. The smell and taste of it is unreal. I believe nature made a mistake.
